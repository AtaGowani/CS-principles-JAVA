# Understanding CS principles through Java
This repository will act as a way for me to understand basic and complex computer science concepts through implementation of these different concepts.
## Why?
I have realized that I lack the ability to apply some of the CS concepts that I have learned in CS 1 and 2. So this repository is here to help me practice implementing different CS concepts and which I am hoping will eventually lead me to a point where when I see a problem while working on a project I can easily recognize how that could be solved with the use/modification of some basic CS algorithms/data structures/etc.
## Things to implement/practice...
